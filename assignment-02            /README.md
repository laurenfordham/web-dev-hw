# Assignment 2
## Lauren Fordham

  I decided to take this class because I have always had an interest in website creation. I have always wondered what goes into one website, and not just a color or font, but how do we even have a selection of color or font. I was interested in mostly the dynamics of how someone is to create a working/interactive site. I created a website for my brother with his jewewlry business and it was super fun. But, I also just went through the directions of the website Wix.com. I have no idea what I did or how I did it!!I think this class will really help me get a grasp of what websites really are. I think I will also get a grasp on how the internet in general works and why.

   I am excited to learn a lot more about the coding that goes into certain actions of a device in order for the internet to work. It will be super cool to learn more about how the internet was founded and what makes it work; which we already went over for the most part in lesson 1. I am also excited to become more proficient in GitHub and Atom!!
