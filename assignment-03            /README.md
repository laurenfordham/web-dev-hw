Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
Browsers work by using web languages to code instructions for how a webpage will function. Using code we can tell a webpage what to do or how to look.
I currently use the browsers safari, chrome, and ecosia.

What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.
Markup Language is used in coding to present the text as it needs to be. Using other keyboard characters we can make certian texts a headline, paragraph, link, and other things. Commonly we use all of these but only when create webpages. We commonly use paragraph elements to make sure our text is not set bold and above everythign else.
